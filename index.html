                <p><strong>27 May</strong> - Style and theme updated.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>1. Don't be a minge</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not advertise other servers.</li>
                    <li>Do not harass or bully other players.</li>
                    <li>Do not intentionally annoy people for your own amusement. This includes the use of high frequency/monotone sound emitters.</li>
                    <li>Do not put innocent lives at risk - nor act as a meat shield for others.</li>
                    <li>Do not Rope Spam (this includes making signs around the map with them).</li>
                    <li>Prop Spam is a permanent ban regardless of size, this is done to protect player progress.</li>
                    <li>When casting a demotion, discuss why in OOC first and give time for the person being demoted to respond e.g. // Demotion of Johnny McSmith for Failrp and NLR any objections?
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not start a vote if objections are raised.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When using any donator commands (!gag, !mute) you must inform staff via admin chat (@) before doing so.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>2. Roleplay (RP) properly</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not abuse /advert or /ooc, this means if you are being raided you cannot do "/advert COPS I'M BEING RAIDED HELP!". Use /cr to report a crime to them instead.</li>
                    <li>Do not AFK money farm, this means you cannot camp your base with printers and watch videos until you get raided.</li>
                    <li>Do not job abuse, this means you cannot change to a shop class, spawn shipments and change back to your previous job straight after.</li>
                    <li>Do not metagame e.g. if a hitman wants to see the Mayor you may not say "No way, you're a hitman and you have a hit on him."</li>
                    <li>Do not Random Death Match (RDM). You must have a valid RP reason (generally life-threatening) for shooting a person.</li>
                    <li>Follow your job description accordingly; don't make your job into something it's not designed to be.</li>
                    <li>Government jobs are not allowed to own Money Printers, unless it is stored in a bank.</li>
                    <li>If any transaction involving currency has occurred, the seller must provide said goods or a refund if sale is unavailable.</li>
                    <li>If custom laws have been added to the law board and the Mayor is killed, all laws on the law board must still be followed.</li>
                    <li>If you trespass into someone's property they reserve the right to kill you without warning, a public shop front would not be considered trespassing.</li>
                    <li>One handed and melee weapons are legal by default.
                        <ul>
                            <li>While one handed and melee weapons are legal, a cop can still arrest you for having the weapon drawn in public.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Mugging players is not allowed on this server. Thieves may pickpocket as an alternative.</li>
                    <li>Stealing during an RP transaction is not allowed, regardless of the job you are playing as.</li>
                    <li>Two handed weapons are illegal by default unless otherwise stated on the law board.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>3. Apply roleplay concepts properly</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow Fear RP, you should value your RP life and not try to evade a person pointing a gun at your head.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a player has a gun pointed at your head you may not draw a weapon on them.</li>
                            <li>When under FearRP you must follow the instigators orders. Getting killed for not following their orders is not considered RDM.</li>
                            <li>When initiating FearRP, please be reasonable with what you request of the victim. Ordering the victim to drop weapons or money is considered mugging.</li>
                            <li>When initiating FearRP, you must point your weapon at the victim for Fear RP to apply. If you turn around or stop threatening the victim at any point it will not be considered FailRP if he draws a gun and kills you.</li>
                            <li>FearRP does not apply to law enforcement roles or the terrorist.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Follow New Life Rule (NLR).
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you die, do not return to the place you were killed within 5 minutes. If you died on your property you may return - however <em>only if there is not an ongoing raid</em>. You must wait for any raids to complete before returning.</li>

                    <li>Tunnels must be wide enough for 2 people and must not force the raiders to crouch. World doors and fading doors are the only allowed "funnel" of one person at a time.</li>

                        <li>As a Hitman, you cannot steal any valuables from any property they break into in order to complete a hit.</li>

                        <li>As a Hitman, you can only accept hits if there is a valid reason for it.</li>

                        <li>Accepting a hit because the target was RDM/RDA is not a valid reason as these are not roleplay concepts.</li>
                        <li>Examples of legitimate hit reasons would be 'the target raided my base', 'the target kidnapped my boss' or 'the target killed my partner'.</li>
                        <li>Generally speaking reasons that are subjective e.g. 'the target is ugly' or 'the targets radio music sucks' are not valid hit reasons.</li>
                        <li>You must know the reason why you are undertaking a hit and the reason must be roleplay based.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, being corrupt does not mean you can RDM/RDA the mayor, join gangs or own illegal items. It simply means you may occasionally let someone pay for you to look the other way. Do not do something you wouldn't see in real life.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not random weapon check. You must have valid suspicion or permission to search a player.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not stun-stick or tazer abuse, use these weapons in moderation.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not random arrest; you must have a valid reason when arresting someone e.g. Attempted Murder.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, do not random warrant; you must have a legitimate reason for it.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, offering bail is encouraged but not required. Bail can not exceed $500</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, you <strong><em>may</em></strong> baton rush to arrest criminals.</li>
                        <li>As a Police Officer, you may only raid a bank to arrest a wanted/warranted individual, or to obtain illegal goods such as weapons or drugs. Money printers can be legally stored in banks, so these can not be touched.</li>

                        <li>Any person with a weapon out on the street should be arrested on sight, regardless of licensing. There is no reason to have a gun out on the street.</li>
                        <li>Organise raids on persons suspected to have printers/drugs/illegal weapons. Stun sticking gives significant cash rewards for destroying illegal entities.</li>
                        <li>Police Officers should only unholster their weapons in life-threatening circumstances. Non-life threatening situations should be approached with the tazer.</li>
