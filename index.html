            <h2>Welcome to Monumental Gaming DarkRP!</h2><br>
            <p>To ensure that all of our players have the best experience possible, we have a comprehensive rule set that must be followed at all times.<br/>
			Please take some time to read through the rules and if you have any questions or need assistance with rule breakers:<br/>
			Politely contact the staff team using admin chat. Eg:  <i>@ Admin I was RDM'd. </i><br/>

            <h3>What is RP?</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
			The main idea behind DarkRP is that you pick a job and roleplay, or act, as that character.<br>
			For example, when playing as a merchant, you wouldn't attack a gangster for robbing a gun store. However, you might wish to report it to police.<br>
			If you were playing as a police officer, then it would be your duty to arrest the gangster if he broke city laws.<br><br>
			
			<b>When playing, you should act as if it were real life.</b><br><br>
			
			Suppose a gangster holds a gun up to your head, and tells you to come with him.<br>
			In real life, there are no respawns, and you would probably comply and go with him.<br>
			In DarkRP, you should act the same as you would in real life, even though the gamemode does have respawns.<br><br>
			
			<b>You act as your character would.</b><br><br>
			
            Examples of roleplay you may wish to try out:

				<li>Play as a Gun Dealer whose business has lasted through generations and talks about his family heritage..</li>
				<li>Or a police officer who isn't happy with his job and would like to earn a little money on the side..</li>
				<li>Perhaps a hobo who was cast into homelessness after returning from a war and who's wife had an affair..</li><br>
			<b>The possibilities go as far as your imagination.</b><br><br>
			
			As you can imagine, it's easier if all players assist each other with playing out their role by replying in character to them.<br>
			It can be difficult to RP when players around are not in character or at the very least, attempting to play the game.<br><br>
			
			New players should consider passive roles and jobs until they become accustomed with the game and gain some confidence for more difficult roles.<br>
            </div>
			

			
            <h3>1. General Rules</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>We permanently ban (without warning) for:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Spamming props, no matter the size or how many props you spam. Don't do it.</li>
							<li>Revealing, or attempting to reveal a players real life identity. Even if it's a "joke".</li>
							<li>DDOS, chatter about DDOS, or make subtle implications about DDOS. Even if it's a "joke".</li>
							<li>Knowingly exploiting unintentional game mechanics, or hiding their existence.</li>
							<li>Money hacking, exploiting the money system, or hiding money exploits.</li>
							<li>The use of any scripts, injections, hacks, and macros outside of binds.</li>
							<li>Evading bans, or assisting others with evading bans.</li>
						</ul><br></li>
						
					<li>Do not advertise other servers, directly or indirectly.</li>
                    <li>Be respectful to everyone out of character. Do not bully or intentionally annoy others.</li>
					<li>Props are only for building. Abusing props (surfing, glitching, climbing, pushing, blocking, etc) is highly frowned upon.</li>
					<li>Custom vehicles of any kind are not allowed. It's highly recommended you keep your props frozen.</li>
                    <li>Do not rope spam. This includes making signs around the map with them, regardless of how artistic you are.</li>
                    <li>Do not use annoying sound emitters or play annoying sounds over your microphone. Mic spam is obviously not allowed.</li>
					<li>When using any donator commands (!gag, !mute) you must inform online staff via admin chat (@) before doing so.</li>
                    <li>When casting a demotion, discuss why in <em>/advert</em> or<em>/OOC</em> first and give time for the person being demoted to respond.</i>
                        <ul>
							<li>Do not start a vote if objections are raised.</li>
							<li>This can only be used for job abuses directly related to RP.</li>
							<li>Eg: <em>/OOC Demotion of Johnny McSmith for FailRP and NLR any objections?</em></li>
                        </ul>
					<li>Do not "ride the rules": Finding loopholes and using them against others while understanding what you are doing is likely not intended.</li>
					<li>Due to the open nature of the game and what people will consider fair play, staff decisions in any given situation are final.
						<ul>
							<li>Do not complain about staffing decisions in game or in global chat. Ban appeals or reports can be made on the forums.</li>
						</ul></li>


            </div>
            <h3>2. Roleplay Properly</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
                <ul>
				
			<b>Basic RP Rules:</b>
                    <li>Do not Random Death Match (RDM). You must have a valid RP reason (generally life threatening) for shooting a person.</li>
					<li>Follow your job description accordingly. Don't make your job into something it's not designed to be.</li>
                    <li>Do not job abuse. This means you cannot change to a shop class, spawn shipments and change back to your previous job straight after.
					    <ul>
							<li>You will be banned if you are caught changing jobs in a manner which gains direct advantage over an immediate situation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Do not metagame. Eg: If a Hitman wants to see the Mayor you cannot reply with "No way, you're a Hitman and you have a hit on him."
						<ul>
							<li>Gangs are seen as gangs, but you are also seen as a Citizen until your gang is breaking the law.
							<li>This means if a police officer comes around the corner and witnesses your gang shooting someone, all of you are somewhat treated as a direct threat.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>There are no OOC roles (such as OOC builder). You are still in character while you build, even if that means you are cold hearted and non-talkative.</li>
					<li>Use the <em>/OOC</em> and <em>/advert</em> chat channels for their intended purpose. Advert is not an off-topic chat room.</li>
					<li>Use <em>/cr</em> to report a crime to the police. Eg: <em>/cr COPS I'M BEING RAIDED AT THE HOSPITAL! HELP!</em></li>
                    <li>Government jobs are not allowed to own Money Printers, unless they are stored in a bank.</li><br>
					
			<b>Weapons and Combat:</b>
                    <li>Trespassing into someone's property gives them the right to kill you without warning.

            <h3>3. Roleplay Mechanics</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
			<b>New Life Rule (NLR):</b>
                    <li>If you die in public, don't return to the place you were killed within 5 minutes if there is an RP situation ongoing.</li>
					<li>If you die on your property, you may only return early if there is no raid or RP situation ongoing.
						<ul>
							<li>You must wait for any raids to complete before returning.</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>When you die, you forget all details about your past life. You remember nothing, apart from needing to avoid your area of death.
						<ul>
							<li>You are not allowed to retaliate against someone who killed you. If you die in a war, you should avoid the entire general area(s) of war.</li>
							<li>You are not allowed to rejoin combat or regain memory just because someone from your old life mentions the same issue in your new life.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>A police officer cannot arrest a person that killed them, however if someone is wanted by the police, the officer may attempt to arrest them.
						<ul>
							<li>This goes to say the police officer who died cannot run directly towards the previous death, but may perhaps find the wanted person nearby. Play fairly.</li>
						</ul>
                    <br>		
					
			<b>FearRP:</b>
                    <li>You must value your RP life and not try to evade a person pointing a gun at your head, or perform other actions which would not be normal.</li>
                    <li>When under FearRP, you must follow the attacker's orders. Getting killed for not following reasonable orders is not RDM.</li>
					<li>When under FearRP, you may not draw a weapon on your attacker unless they turn away first.</li>
                    <li>When initiating FearRP, please be reasonable with what you request of the victim. 
						<ul>
							<li>Ordering the victim to drop weapons, money, or the contents of their pocket is not permitted.</li>
							<li>Ordering the victim to unlock their base in order for you to steal items is not permitted.</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>When initiating FearRP, you must point your weapon at the victim for FearRP to apply. 
						<ul>
							<li>If you turn around or stop threatening the victim at any point it will not be considered FailRP if he draws a gun and kills you.</li>
						</ul></li>
                    <li>FearRP does not apply to law enforcement roles or the terrorist.</li>
					<br>
					
			<b>Raiding:</b>
					<li>NO RDM: Do not kill bystanders (especially the Mayor) unless they pose a direct threat to your raid.</li>
					<li>You must <em>/advert Raid</em> prior to beginning your raid. This is for transparency purposes and is considered out of character.
						<ul>
							<li>Broad adverts (<em>/advert mug|raid|thief|counterraid|kidnap|hit</em>) are not tolerated. Adverts must be clear and specific in nature.
							<li>It is Metagaming if people respond to your advert in-character. Eg: Arrest you prior to any actual raid, or run away, etc.
							<li>If raiding together, you must <em>/advert Raid with Name</em> with your partners name in the message.
						</ul>
					<li>You must wait 10 seconds after advertising to commence your raid. You cannot kill any targets during this time either.</li>
					<li>If you realise during the raid that the base is already being raided, you must leave instantly and <em>/advert Raid Cancelled/Over</em></li>
					<li>Police are only considered a direct threat to the raid only if they are directly and knowingly observing it.</li>
                    <li>You may not heal yourself (includes health stations and health packs) or pick up additional armour during a raid.</li>
                    <li>If you die during a raid you cannot come back afterwards and keep helping with the raid.</li>
                    <li>You cannot steal items which are crucial for someone job, they may be destroyed however.
						<ul>
							<li>These items include microphones, bomb generators, meth cookware, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>You must <em>/advert Raid Over</em> when you have completed your raid and exited the building.</li>
                    <li>A group may only raid the same base 15 minutes after their previous raid was finished.
                    <li>Raids can only last up to 10 minutes. Once a raid has reached this time limit, it is over and the raider must leave.
						<ul>
							<li>Do not shoot raiders who are leaving because of the 10 minute time limit.</li>
							<li>Raiders cannot intentionally stall by calling raid then randomly roaming the streets for several minutes.</li>
							<li>Raiders cannot intentionally stall if they have finished the raid. Leave and call it over.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Hitmen/Ninjas are allowed to raid, however only to kill a target. They cannot touch, steal, or destroy any property or allow others to.</li><br>
			
			<b>Declaring War:</b>
					<li>All 3 gangs can wage war between each other. All 3 gangs can also wage war (one at a time) against the Government.</li>
                    <li>No gangs are at war by default. To start a war the gang leader must <em>/advert</em> who the war is against and ask them to accept.</li>
                    <li>Gangs must have 2 members (including the leader) to commence a war.</li>
					<li>If the opposing leader declines or doesn't reply you cannot commence a war.</li>
                    <li>The Government cannot initiate a war, but the Mayor (or Police Chief if no Mayor) can accept a war declaration.</li>
                    <li>The war is over when all members of a gang/group are killed once each.
						<ul>
							<li>Once you have died during a war, you cannot rearm and walk around with a gun trying to involve yourself again.</li>
						</ul></li>
                    <li>You must <em>/advert War Over</em> once all members have been killed.</li>
					<li>You cannot gang up in wars. Eg: Blood and Crip vs the Mafia.</li>
                    <li>Each group has their own 10 minute 'war cooldown' where they must wait before they can participate again.</li><br>
					
			<b>Kidnapping:</b>
					<li>Only two thieves working together or a gang with two members (including the leader) may kidnap.</li>
					<li>Kidnappings can only last up to 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>You may not kidnap citizens or jobs that work alone.</li>
					<li>The maximum you can ransom someone for is $10,000.</li>
					<li>If no one pays the ransom you may kill or release the victim.</li>
                    <li>You must <em>/advert Kidnap</em> before commencing a kidnapping and also <em>/advert Kidnap Over</em> after it has been completed.
						<ul>
							<li>Once you advert a kidnap you are required to wait 10 seconds before commencing, just like raiding.</li>
						</ul></li>
                    <li>You must follow FearRP when being kidnapped.</li>

            <h3>4. Base Building Guidelines</h3>
            <div class="dropdown">
			
			<b>General Base Rules:</b>
					<li>You cannot block key routes or build on roads or footpaths. This includes making toll booths for either roads or tunnels.</li>
                    <li>You cannot enclose public resources or NPC's within personal property. Eg: Vending Machines/Drug Dealers.</li>
                    <li>You may only purchase a door if you are using the interior of the building the door is attached to.</li>
					<li>No one-way material props/materials/trickery is allowed. Both sides of a prop must be equally visible. (Including world areas)</li>
                    <li>Using no-collided props to walk through is unrealistic and not allowed, even if it is transparent.</li>
					<li>Do not black box, this means making all the walls in your base very dark, causing confusion to other people.</li>
					<li>You cannot build your base in a way where your valuables are destroyed if you get raided. Eg: Forcing a printer underwater.</li>
                    <li>Do not use constraints unless absolutely necessary. Unfrozen builds without reason will be removed.
						<ul>
							<li>Only constrain your build when you are ready to save. (Feel free to use Smart Constraint)</li>
							<li>When pasting with advanced dupe, ensure that it is "Frozen and Without Constraints".</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>Players that are building may place a "Building" sign, disallowing people from raiding their base. Please note:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They must be actively building a base and have no valuables.</li>
                            <li>Typical base rules firmly apply when the base has valuables.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Signs are to be used for RP purposes only and may only be placed on or inside the owner's property.
						<ul>
							<li>An RP legitimate protest may spawn signs in public. It's a protest after all!</li>
							<li>Screens are not allowed to float above a street. You must incorporate them into a sign if you want to advertise this way.</li>
						</ul><br>

			<b>Base Defences:</b>
                    <li>KOS tunnels must be wide enough for two people in all directions and must not force the raiders to crouch or jump. (Including world areas)</li>
					<li>KOS tunnels (and pits) are not permitted to have any holes (faded or not) in the floor where raiders can inadvertently fall off.</li>
					<li>World doors and fading doors are the only allowed areas of your base which can fit one person at a time.</li>
					<li>You cannot use typical fence props (that can be shot through) as a part of your base defenses.</li>
					<li>You cannot design your base in a way where you can run out a secret door and attack raiders from behind.</li>
                    <li>Players must not be required to break glass in order to get into your base.</li>
				<br>
				
			<b>Fading Door Rules:</b>
					<li>Only two locked doors may be used in a base. A locked door is considered a locked world door, or a fading door.
						<ul>
							<li>The first door is for the primary entrance, and a second door may be used to defend valuables.</li>
							<li>You have a maximum of 1 locked door in your entrance, regardless of how your entrance is designed.</li>
		                    <li>Doors must be built with a single prop to ensure they can be lock picked. No overlapping props are allowed at doors.</li>
							<li>All fading doors must be lockpickable and have an attached keypad/button directly next to the door, on both sides, which is clearly visible.</li>
                            <li>The keypad must stay open for at least 4 seconds once a successful password has been entered.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
					<li>You may have 2 extra doors, however these doors can only be triggered by buttons which must be placed directly on the centre or side of the door.</li>
					<li>All elevators and timed doors are considered a locked door. While you can use them, it's strategically far better that you don't.</li>
					<li>You are not permitted to use any kotkeys or fast methods of access to get through your front door. You must use your keypad.</li>
					<li>Fading doors are to be used as doors, windows and box lids only. Don't make bridges, stairs, floors or ceilings that fade.</li>

					<li>Fading car door entrances must stay open for at least 4 seconds, no matter the method used to fade.</li>
					<li>You must not pulse, fade, use, or open any door that is being lock picked. Note: This does not apply to windows.</li>
					<li>You are permitted to use custom doors (such as SteamID doors) for your valuable room only. The front door must be a normal type.</li>
				<br>
					
			<b>Fading Window Rules:</b>
					<li>Fading windows must be positioned on the same level as the target area. They cannot be on a second story, for example.
						<ul>
							<li>Using any windows (fading or not) on the roof or floor is not permitted.</li>
							<li>Only an open (no fading windows) ledge that overlooks the front of a base is permitted to be out of level with the target area.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Fading windows must stay open for at least one second once they are used. (Hold them open manually, toggle, wire timer, etc)
					<li>A fading window must look like a window. Eg: Glass, tinted, fence material, etc. They cannot be opaque or fully transparent.</li>
					<li>Fading props cannot be the same material as its surroundings in an attempt to hide it. This applies to all fading props.</li>
					<li>Advanced: A fading window prop must be of a height where person's on both sides can see waist to head, whether armed or not.
						<ul>
							<li>This means a minimum window height of '05' when looking at the tooltip measurements of a plate or block.</li>
							<li><i>(You can find these props by searching for '05' in the Q menu)</i></li>
						</ul>
				<br>
				
			<b>Shop Rules:</b>
					<li>Gun stores and other shops must be built within the following guidelines:
						<ul>
							<li>Wiremod automatic bases are permitted as long as you are not always AFK. You still need to roleplay.
							<li>Stores must have a front counter area where trading with customers takes place.
							<li>The shop owner must man the counter and also must be clearly visible to facilitate roleplay.
							<li>Stores without a front counter are not in the best interests of RP and will be removed.</li>
						</ul>
                    <li>The store itself should be primarily defended from inside the base. This means unmanned kiosks are not allowed.</li><br>
				
			<b>Wiremod:</b>
					<li>Using Wiremod entities for anything apart from their intended design is not tolerated.
						<ul>
							<li>A button is to be used as a button, a pixel is to be used as a pixel, etc.
						</ul>
					<li>You are not permitted to actively hide any buttons or keypads in a base which has valuables in it.
						<ul>
							<li>You must not use materials which blend them into the background.
							<li>You must not use colours or transparencies which blend them into the background.
							<li>You must not use tiny buttons/pads placed on areas which make them difficult to see.
							<li>You must not hide buttons under furniture, behind props, in small gaps, etc.
						</ul>

<li>IMPORTANT! Fully Reworked Arrest System for All Law Enforcement:
	<ul>
<li>Police officers can NO LONGER arrest players directly with the baton. They MUST first be hand cuffed.
<li>Tazing a player now ragdolls them for 5 seconds. (They cannot speak during this this 5 seconds)
<li>After the ragdoll, the player can't move for 5 seconds. This allows you time to hand cuff AND speak to them.
<li>Players can be cuffed without being tazed, however it's much harder to do when they are moving around.
<li>Law Enforcement can now arrest Law Enforcement again. This helps with corruption and varies RP.
<li>Tazers now show you their power/reload status on the back of the weapon.
<li>Tazers spawn on Law Enforcement with 3 charges instead of 1.
<li>Tazers now reload in ~3 seconds.
<li>Tazers have a 25% increased range.

<li>Another Hired Goon model. Pick by choosing job through F4 menu.
